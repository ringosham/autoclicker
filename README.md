# Autoclicker

A (low level?) autoclicker that uses normal distribution to click. Configurable hotkeys, left/right click and timing.

Does not support the following
* Non-US keyboard layouts
* Key with modifiers (No Ctrl/Shift/Alt + [Key])
* F10 and Alt (Microsoft treat these keys differently. See [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/desktop/inputdev/wm-keydown)
* Print screen (Why would you want to use this anyway)
* Game mouse buttons
* Macro keys might be supported, but untested.

Written for for some C# practise and peronsal use.
